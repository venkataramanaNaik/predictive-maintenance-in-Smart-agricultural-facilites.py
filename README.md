# predictive-maintenance-in-Smart-agricultural-facilites.py
This project implements an advanced AI system that combines deep learning and machine learning methods (LSTM and XGBoost) with eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques for predictive maintenance in smart agricultural facilities. The solution processes multi-modal data from sensors, weather stations, crop records predict equipment failures and maintenance 
 System Requirements
#  Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

For dashboard: modern web browser

# 2. Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
cd yourrepo
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, xgboost, shap, lime, dash, plotly

# 3. Data Preparation
Place your raw data (.csv files containing sensor readings, maintenance, weather, and crop data) into the data/ directory.

Make sure missing values and categorical data follow expected formats. Refer to projectâ€™s /docs or code comments for details.

# 4. Data Preprocessing
Clean raw data, handle missing values, normalize, and extract features:

bash
python preprocessing.py
# 5. Model Training
Train the predictive models (LSTM and/or XGBoost):

bash
python model_training.py
This will output trained model files and performance metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC).

# 6. Model Explainability
Run explainability module to generate explanations:

bash
python explainability.py
SHAP and LIME plots will be saved, showing both global (overall feature importance) and local (per instance) explanations.

# 7. User Interface (Dashboard)
Launch the dashboard for browsing predictions and explanations:

bash
python dashboard.py
Open http://localhost:8050 in your web browser.

# 8. Usage and Interpretation
Data Ingestion: Upload or connect real-time data in the dashboard.

Predictions: Access predictions and maintenance recommendations.

Explanations: View why the model made each prediction (via SHAP/LIME plots).

Reports: Export results for operational use.

# 9. Security & Best Practices
All sensitive information and user logs are encrypted (AES).

User-access is managed by RBAC and secure authentication.

# 10. Testing
Unit and integration tests available in the tests/ folder.

Run all tests to ensure correct behavior:

bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
